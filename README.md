# dotfiles of sakjur

These are essentially my dotfiles.
There's nothing special with them, but they are mine, so I like them.

As usual, I have pretty much stolen these from
[eevee](https://github.com/eevee/rc). So much credit goes to eevee for
everything that you happen to like with my dotfiles, although I try to
make them work better for a bilingual european rather than an american.
